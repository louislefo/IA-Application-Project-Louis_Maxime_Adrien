# "AI Football Scout" Project Structure

This document details the organization of the project's files and folders.

## 📂 Folder Organization

### `src/` (Source Code)
This is where all the Python code for the project is located.
*   **`application.py`**: The user interface (Streamlit). This is the file to launch to use the app.
*   **`ml_analysis.py`**: The "brain" script that trains the AI models and saves them.
*   **`data_analysis.py`**: Script to test and explore data before using it.
*   **`test_setup.py`**: Utility script to verify that everything is installed correctly.

### `data/` (Data)
Storage for CSV files.
*   **`fifa_players.csv`**: The main source file with player statistics.
*   **`history.csv`**: Automatically generated file that saves your search history in the application.

### `models/` (AI Brains)
This folder contains the "pickle" files (`.pkl`). These are the AI models trained by `ml_analysis.py` and ready to be used by `application.py`.
*   `regression_model.pkl`
*   `classification_model.pkl`

### `doc/` (Documentation)
All project documentation.
*   **`code_explanation.md`**: Technical overview.
*   **`explication application/`**: Folder containing detailed explanations of each file (`application.md`, `ml_analysis.md`).

### `Images/`
Stores images generated by scripts (e.g., performance charts) or used in the interface.

## 🚀 Simplified Workflow

1.  **Training**: Run `src/ml_analysis.py` -> Reads `data/` -> Creates files in `models/`.
2.  **Usage**: Run `src/application.py` -> Loads `models/` -> User interacts via the browser.
