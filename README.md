Title : AI Football Performance Analyzer

Proposal :

Our project aims to develop an intelligent application that can analyze football players’ performances using Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to create a system capable of taking into account a wide range of data including speed, endurance, technical skills, positioning, and decision-making to provide a comprehensive assessment of each player’s abilities.

Using computer vision and machine learning models, the application would process match videos and extract performance metrics such as distance covered, successful passes, ball control efficiency, and defensive positioning. These metrics would then be analyzed by AI algorithms to generate personalized insights and improvement suggestions.

This project demonstrates how AI can revolutionize the way coaches and analysts evaluate players, offering an objective, data-driven perspective that complements human expertise.
